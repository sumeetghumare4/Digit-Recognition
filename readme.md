This code helps you classify different digits using softmax regression.

## Code Requirements 🦄
You can install Conda for python which resolves all the dependencies for machine learning.

## Description 🏦
Softmax Regression (synonyms: Multinomial Logistic, Maximum Entropy Classifier, or just Multi-class Logistic Regression) is a generalization of logistic regression that we can use for multi-class classification (under the assumption that the classes are mutually exclusive). In contrast, we use the (standard) Logistic Regression model in binary classification tasks.
